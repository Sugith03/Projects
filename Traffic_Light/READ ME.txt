Inspiration
I'm putting together this traffic light with Arduino, and it's not just a cool DIY thing â€“ it's like this whole learning experience in programming and electronics. 
Plus, it's giving me a deep dive into how traffic management systems work, and I get to add my own creative touches to the mix. It's a pretty neat project overall!

What it does
The traffic light built with Arduino simulates real-world traffic signals, enabling programmed control over the sequencing of lights 
and serving as an educational tool for understanding traffic management principles

How I built it

Jumper wires 
LED: Red
LED: Green
LED: Yellow
Breadbaord
Arduino DUE

Challenges I ran into
- Unfortunately, did not have a yellow LED,but instead I substituted it with a green LED
- Arduino DUE was drawing power from my laptop instead of the 9V battery
- Not enough materials (exm: If I had a button, I could have implemented an if-else statement for the pedestrian feature)

What I learned
- pinMode function is used to configure a specific pin on the Arduino board as either an input or an output
- the digitalWrite function is used to set the state of a digital output pin
- HIGH (sets the led on) and LOW (sets the led off)

Built With

Arduino software (C program)
